Football-League-Management-System
=================================

This is a small management system I've developed as an individual project for
the ASP.NET MVC course at Telerik Academy

Features:
- Public, registered, management and administration areas
- CRUD for Leagues, Seasons, Teams, Players and Matches
- League standings

I am using the trial version of KendoUI for ASP.NET MVC (not included in the repository), so the code will not
compile without it.
